# Node-JS-review

Step 1: Install Node.js
If you haven’t installed Node.js yet, download it from nodejs.org and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Create a New Project Directory
Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal you prefer) and create a new directory for your project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir my-express-app
cd my-express-app
Step 3: Initialize a New Node.js Project
Run the following command to create a package.json file. You can press Enter to accept the default options or customize them as needed.

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
Step 4: Install Express
Now, install Express using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install express
Step 5: Create the Main Application File
Create a file named index.js (or any name you prefer) in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
touch index.js
Step 6: Set Up Basic Express Server
Open index.js in a text editor and add the following code to set up a simple Express server:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
Step 7: Run Your Express Server
You can run your server using Node.js:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
If you want to use nodemon for automatic restarts during development, install it globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g nodemon
Then you can run your server with nodemon:

bash
Copy code
nodemon index.js
Step 8: Access Your Application
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the port you specified). You should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

Additional Steps (Optional)
Install Additional Packages: You can install other middleware like body-parser or morgan as needed.

bash
Copy code
npm install body-parser morgan
Set Up Environment Variables: Use the dotenv package for managing environment variables. Install it with:

bash
Copy code
npm install dotenv
Create a .env file in your project root and add your variables there.

Structure Your Application: As your application grows, consider creating separate folders for routes, controllers, and models to keep your code organized.

That’s it! You now have a basic Express server up and running. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
